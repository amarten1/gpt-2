However, this reveals that Oliver is unaware that Ray had faked his own death; in actuality it was Thea's death. In order to protect her and her friends, Ray calls in Thea's old friend, Thea King.

She meets up with Diggle and Thea later together and meets him again a couple weeks later after a short conversation. Diggle tells her about his encounter with Damien Darhk and tells him about a new character being seen in the city as his own alter-ego, Damien Darhk. Diggle tells her about another alter-ego, \"Thakal,\" who is also playing off of another character, \"Kalifa.\" When Diggle tells Thea he has been in contact with both men, she claims that Diggle has been an ally. Thea believes this was just a ploy to steal her information. However, she does mention the possible threat that she could have.\n",

            "Diggle is investigating Darhk again and asks her to take him to the hospital to see a doctor. She goes to leave and calls Diggle and he calls out back telling her not to leave. As Laurel visits Oliver and Damien, he is watching Thea's apartment. Diggle walks over to the door where he meets another woman there. He asks for her name and she admits she does not wish to answer. In order for her to respond, he can ask to see her phone number or phone she answered before it was stolen. He then asks about what she did when she became pregnant with Thea and she replies that she was pregnant for the third time when she returned to L.A. in order for her to not leave the city. At this time, \"Khalifa\" approaches them. He attacks Diggle, causing her to lose her balance. Diggle breaks off his arm and he takes advantage of this by telling her he has seen who was involved with her previous murder, calling in Oliver and saying they will look into this. When Diggle tells her she is an accomplice, she claims she is still alive and asks for his help. Diggle tells her to leave him alone, then she falls to the ground and attempts to grab Thea. This kills her.\n",

Halif then kills a cop nearby who is not dead. When Halif tells her that he is the original Oliver Queen, Thea asks if he can have some of her blood. Halif says yes, to which Thea screams \"YOU ARE DEAD TO ME! YOU ARE DEAD TO ME!!\" before Halif kills her. At this point, Diggle arrives and tells Thea that they need to be careful. He says they will take care of her before he makes his move, causing her to lose her balance as he strikes. Thea gets up, but she is too slow and falls again, but she is able to stay at Diggle's side and they walk off together. Diggle then tells Oliver that he has been working with Thea King, a young woman who he saw in the apartment. Diggle tells Oliver he needs to get him home, prompting Oliver to tell him to come take the rest of the gang to the apartment. Oliver later finds Thea and invites her over for dinner in his apartment.\n",

He tells him to take Thea there as the surgery will be a while.\n",

She calls for the gun, but Diggle leaves before she can call the police in the ambulance. The two then arrive at a hospital together. Diggle then tells her how it happened.

Microsoft's online marketing team, known as Microsoft SMB Team (MSMBt), gets calls from a whole host of thousands of potential candidates for job offers just as often as Microsoft hires sales people.\n",
            "\n",
            "So what does this mean? Not much. Most of these candidates won't respond to the calls at all, not even when it comes to a promotion. So all those calls, sent out, probably will never make it into the hands of customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "But some calls do, so why should our online marketing team let such negativity creep in? Well, we thought we would talk about some of them.\n",

            "That said, Microsoft does offer a variety of rewards for both methods (although I wouldn't call them free).\n",
            "\n",
            "Microsoft gives you 10 free Skype calls a month, which is great even though it doesn't deliver very tangible results. That's because these calls are paid services – so they usually cost you money because your payment is part of the marketing effort.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "This means that only a very small percentage of companies actually reach out for calls if they're interested in buying your product – for example salespeople that can't make a big dent in your numbers.\n",

            "Some companies that are great at online marketing have dedicated teams of dedicated calls where people are directed to do particular tasks that you do for them. These calls serve as a way of showing what you offer and making them pay for you. Microsoft has one of these calls dedicated to selling Microsoft Office and Skype and, again, that's pretty good value for money if you're looking to do something cool.\n",

Your phone calls may go wrong, maybe a person is calling to ask a question they don't have the space to say. Or you might have people spam you with e-mails that simply say \"Sorry I'm busy. I'm sorry I've never called you before.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Call quality isn't that great either. That the quality of calls from customers is generally poor means that most of your calls will end with you saying \"Sorry.\" And that's usually why customers won't make sales calls – they want your customer service, but they're not comfortable speaking to you about it.\n",

            "Some organizations might have to sell their salespeople, and for a reason they don't want to disclose. Microsoft gives this reason in the form of a \"free call\" – so you get a few calls if someone shows up in person who can sell your product (and that's usually the case).\n",
            "\n",
            "But all these free calls also serve an important purpose; they get companies to call.\n",
